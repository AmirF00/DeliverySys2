# Delivery Sys 2.0

## Difficulties along the way 
	1. part 1 
		1. -> creating true random in computers so solved it by using time as seed
		1.a -> implementing search function for double linked lists so solved with understanding ADT and some search 

	2. part 2 
		2.a multi threading and race condition. I had to protect my critical zones by some method of protection. some produce and demand issue too still trying to figure out. 



PS honestly I am waffling there, I am on wierd roll so not much problems so far.
